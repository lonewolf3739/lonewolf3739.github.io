Mathematics is an art, and art should be taught by working artists, or
if not, at least by people who appreciate the art form and can recognize
it when they see it. It is not necessary that you learn music from a
professional composer, but would you want yourself or your child to be
taught by someone who doesn’t even play an instrument, and has never
listened to a piece of music in their lives? Would you accept as an art
teacher someone who has never picked up a pencil or stepped foot in a
museum? Why is it that we accept math teachers who have never produced
an original piece of mathematics, know nothing of the history and
philosophy of the subject, nothing about recent developments, nothing in
fact beyond what they are expected to present to their unfortunate
students? What kind of a teacher is that? How can someone teach
something that they themselves don’t do?
